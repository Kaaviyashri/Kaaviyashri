# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaaviyashri Saraboji

**Software Engineer | AI Explorer | Building Real-World Intelligent Systems**

---

I'm a graduate student in Software Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse, holding prior degrees in Computer Science from India. My work spans full-stack web development, applied artificial intelligence, and intelligent systems that solve practical problems.

Currently, I'm exploring the intersections of computer vision, NLP, and generative AI. My goal is to build ethical, useful, and research-informed AI tools that bridge academic curiosity with real-world impact.
