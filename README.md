## **About Me**

I am an **AI and Machine Learning Engineer** with over **four years of professional experience** designing, building, and integrating **production-ready machine learning systems** into real-world software across **financial services, healthcare, and public-impact domains**. I bring a strong **software engineering foundation**, allowing me to build systems that are **reliable, scalable, and maintainable** beyond experimentation.

My work spans the **entire machine learning lifecycle**, including **data ingestion, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, deployment, and post-deployment monitoring**. I have built **transaction anomaly detection pipelines** processing high-volume financial data, **computer vision systems** optimized for low-latency inference, and **NLP-based services** embedded directly into user-facing applications to support automation and decision-making.

Alongside applied ML, I have deep experience in **core software engineering**, including **algorithms and data structures, concurrency, performance optimization, API design, automated testing, and system reliability**. I regularly work with **validation-heavy workflows, secure authentication, logging, and CI/CD-aligned development practices** to ensure correctness and robustness in production environments.

I am also actively engaged in **responsible and governance-aligned AI**. I am the developer of **ARISTOTLE**, a **WHO-aligned ethical readiness assessment tool for healthcare AI systems**, recognized by **WiSys and IEEE**. This work shapes how I approach ML system design with an emphasis on **auditability, accountability, and real-world deployment constraints**.

I am interested in roles where I can **own systems in production**, collaborate across **software, data, and product teams**, and contribute to building **scalable, trustworthy, and impactful AI-powered software**.
