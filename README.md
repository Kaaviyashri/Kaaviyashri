## AI / Machine Learning Engineer | Software Engineer

I am an AI and Machine Learning Engineer with over four years of experience designing, building, and integrating machine learning systems into production software across financial services, healthcare, and public-impact domains. I bring a strong software engineering foundation and focus on building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and deployable in real-world environments.

My work spans end-to-end machine learning pipelines, including data ingestion, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, deployment, and post-deployment monitoring. I have built production anomaly-detection pipelines processing high-volume financial transactions, computer vision systems optimized for low-latency inference, and NLP-based services embedded directly into user-facing applications to support decision-making and automation.

Alongside applied ML, I have extensive experience in software engineering fundamentals such as algorithmic problem solving, concurrency, performance optimization, API design, automated testing, and system reliability. I regularly work with validation-heavy workflows, secure authentication, structured logging, and CI/CD-aligned development practices to ensure correctness and scalability.

I am also actively engaged in responsible and governance-aligned AI. I am the designer of **ARISTOTLE**, a WHO-aligned ethical readiness assessment tool for healthcare AI systems, recognized by WiSys and IEEE. This work informs my approach to ML system design with an emphasis on auditability, accountability, and real-world deployment constraints.

I am interested in roles where I can own systems in production, collaborate closely with software, data, and product teams, and contribute to building scalable, trustworthy, and impactful AI-powered software.

## Selected Projects

### ARISTOTLE – Ethical Readiness Assessment Tool for Healthcare AI
Designed and built a WHO-aligned ethical readiness assessment platform that translates global AI ethics principles into structured scoring, readiness classification, and actionable recommendations for healthcare AI systems. Implemented weighted scoring, principle-level aggregation, and privacy-preserving client-side reporting with automated PDF generation.

### Habitat for Humanity Application & Volunteer Portal
Developed a secure full-stack MERN application supporting housing applications and volunteer workflows. Implemented a 26-step validation-heavy application pipeline, role-based access control, audit trails, and an NLP-based conversational assistant achieving approximately 85% intent-classification accuracy.

### AI-Driven Wildlife Detection System
Built a computer vision pipeline using Python, OpenCV, YOLO, and TensorFlow to detect wildlife in roadside video streams. Optimized preprocessing and inference to reduce end-to-end latency and support near-real-time and edge-deployment constraints.
