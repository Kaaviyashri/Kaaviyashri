## About Me
I am an AI and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong software engineering foundation, focused on building production-oriented ML systems and reliable backend applications. My experience spans applied machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and core software engineering practices that emphasize correctness, performance, and maintainability.

I have worked on large-scale anomaly detection pipelines processing high-volume transactional data, low-latency computer vision systems, and NLP services integrated into real applications to automate decision and support workflows. Alongside ML development, I design and maintain API-driven systems with secure authentication, validation-intensive workflows, and automated testing to ensure system reliability.

I also work on governance-aligned and responsible AI systems, including ARISTOTLE, a WHO-aligned ethical readiness assessment tool for healthcare AI recognized by WiSys and IEEE.
